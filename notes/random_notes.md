# 12 
- [CLIP Interrogator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pharma/CLIP-Interrogator) 
	- inverse problems 
	- not possible to invert the clip image encoder 
	- thats why the texts it spits back are fun/interesting but not actually the "correct prompt"
	- uses [BLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12086) language model

## Matrix Mult Notebook `01_matmul`
- Einstein Summation
	- learn a little about that
	- faster than the broadcast trick
- but of course we can run it directly in torch with `matmul` or `@`
- That was CPU
- Now onto using CUDA
- a `mat_mul` that just takes a coordinate and computes just that one value of the matrix and leaves else as 0. Fills in one piece of the grid.
	- can do in parallel b/c all independent 
	- uses GPU kernel 
	- `from numba import cuda`, `@cuda.jit`
	- `cuda.to_device()` to put the devices on the GPU.
	- also a concept of `blocks`, `TPB`, threads per block
- was so much faster on the GPU. A 5 Million X change in this

## Mean Shift Notebook
- we need to be good at all the matrix multiplications, broadcasting, mechanical operations , tensor operations etc. Practice Practice Practice! 
	- That is the purpose of the mean shift clustering notebook. To practice the things we learned in the mat mul notebook
	- Also see the HW suggestions on implementing some stuff on just GPU
- `functools.partial` , uses a lot. In this example was used for the plotting. 
- `X = data.clone()`, pytorch thing
- go over those broadcast rules!
- [**norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics))
	- comes up all he time when dealing with distances, loss functions etc.
	- l2 norm is euclidean 
- matplotlib FuncAnimation 
- broadcasting on GPU, do things in batches 
	- does the mean shift over again on GPU with batches
	- those broadcasting rules are really important!

## Calculus
- you use to teach that but would be good to refresh on the Matrix Calc stuff.


## TODO 
- rewrite l2 norm euclidean distance with ein sum notation
- implement k-means clustering, dbscan, locality sensitive hashing, or some other clustering, fast nearest neighbors, or similar algorithm of your choice, on the GPU. Check if your version is faster than a pure python or CPU version.
- Invent a new meanshift algorithm which picks only the closest points, to avoid quadratic time.
- make an animation
- go over those notebooks

- would be really fun to implement [product quantization](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/product-quantization/) with torch and GPU and then plug in with my Kmeans GPU and then try to improve mean shift with this approx NN search etc.

# 13
## backprop Notebook
- starting off with 03_backprop notebook
- stack of two layers with MNIST and simple MSE loss
- going over derivatives and gradients background knowledge 
- cool little trick of using `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` interactive debugger within the notebook. Can also achieve same thing with `breakpoint()`. `c` to continue and `n` for next line. Actually `breakpoint()` does not work with Jupyter notebook. 

### Refactoring the Above BackProp with Layers as Classes
- see the notebook. `__call__` as the forward pass and `backward` as the method for backward pass and using `self.blah` to store the layers and intermediate steps etc.
- we did it this way so then we could subclass `nn.Module`
	- definitely spend some time practicing that 

## MiniBatch Training NoteBook
- talking about how we could use a different LOSS function. MSE not the best approach for that classification. 
	- softmax function,  cross entropy loss, log softmax
- Log Sum Exp trick . That's cool. Avoid super high numbers and floating point issues.
- `nll_loss` negative log likelihood loss, log_softmax, and cross_entropy that puts them together. Need to study this and go over it slower. All come from `F` module 


## TODO
- at some point read [# The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/)
- do the 03 backprop notebook on your own
    - feel free to do some parts slightly differently.
    - the main objective is to do some forward and backward passes and derivatives from scratch without using autograd. 
    - Write the math out on paper. I honestly find it easier to code up after seeing it on paper first. Put in image of that in the notebook. 
    - PRACTICE PRACTICE the subclassing `nn.module` and looking at some simple examples on torch docs
    - review/practice some basic train loops in torch
- review some basic softmax and cross entropy stuff, nll_loss, log_softmax, cross_entropy
    - implement yourself and compare with torch 
- good docs on [nn.module](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html)
- From last week go and try the product quantization. Does it male Mean shift quicker?
- Also see TODOs from last week you didn't do yet!
- Someone recommended this [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB-u77Y5a6A&list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r&t=2312s) for backprop and 
    it was amazing. Especially for higher dimensional Jacobian's and some simple heuristics and rules for getting shapes to match up etc.

- `Dataset` class 
	- our own simple dataset class first from scratch
- DataLoader

	- again, always looking at how we can implement a simple class on our own first
	- random sampling, samplers, batch samplers, `collate_fn`
	- multi processing data loader

	- passing in a function that some other function will call at particular times
- lambdas and partials 

## TODO

	- is there arm docker images?
	- Right now `uname -m` is printing `x86_64` and emulation is slow!
- learn about torch datasets and data loaders
	- `DataLoader, SequentialSampler, RandomSampler, BatchSampler` etc.
- understand the data loader stuff in `04_minibatch_training.ipynb` notebook

## 07_convolutions.ipynb

- convolutions explained
	- [link](https://medium.com/impactai/cnns-from-different-viewpoints-fab7f52d159c)
- going through example of 3by3 edge detector kernel
- talking about [img2col](img2col convolution) convolution algorithm which turns it into a Matrix Mult under the hood
- [`F.unfold`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Unfold.html )
- [F.conv2d](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.conv2d.html)
- strides and padding
	- reduce dimensionality of input is super useful such as auto-encoder
- Note there is this ideas of grouped convolutions and `groups` argument.
	- In most applications Ive seen `groups=1`

- half way point break

## 08_autoencoder
- need to review some things :) 
- warm up classifier code on fashion mnist 
- autoencoder
	- stride 2 compressing in the first part
	- TF Keras2 book had some good stuff on these convs for upsampling in autoencoder like networks
	- nearest neighbour upsampling with stride 1 convolution --> double grids size
	- a deconvolutional layer
	- `padding=ks//2`
- see new fit and eval
- So Jeremy was trying to do an autoencoder on mnist
	- not working to well
	- good illustration basically
	- code was training slow (cpu bottle necks etc)
		- dataloader was slow
	- Not fast enough to experiment on
	- So the take away is **don't work like this**
	- Have code that you can run hundreds of experiments on quickly.
		- runs fast but can also iterate fast.
	- This motivates the 09_learner notebook
		- we need our own custom learner 
		- got to stop doing things manually

## 09_learner
- start off at 1:35 in video.
- going through the learner class
	- the first one is only good for classification
	- not flexible enough for our purposes
- metric class (base metric class)
- `@property` is nice.
- now onto new learner with callbacks :) 
	- `with_cbs`
- lots of nifty python going on here
	- like back to that 06foundations stuff
- I def need to practice the call backs and decorators etc.

## TODO
- I wrote out some notes on convolutions once, would be nice to find them
- Would be good to find a simple little problem to work on to practice
    - dataset and dataloader again to refresh memory from lesson14
    - simple conv network with some RGB images
    - simple train loop
    - all from scratch just to practice 
    - I think the classifier would be good on fashion mnist for example or any other small dataset from HF or whatever. To practice collate , ds, dl, train, eval, etc.
- review some stuff from the 08_autoencoder notebook that was assumed remembered from last week
    - go through from scratch 
- go through the 09_learner notebook
    - learn more python! callbacks, decorators, etc.
    - build something simple with some of these ideas
        - partials
        - __getattr__
        - callbacks
        - decorators 

# 16

## 09_learner
- seems like he redid this so lets start over this notebook from scratch
- almost first half of this lesson was going through all this stuff and callbacks
- go through this carefully
- learning rate finder

## 10_activations
- the higher the learn rate, often can find more generalizable set of weights 
	- and training with less batches less likely to overfit
	- stable training
- Looking Inside the Model with Hooks
- plotting activations (means and std)
    - want the mean of activations close to 0 and std close to 1. Basically want a nice spread. 
        - Not all zero
        - Classic shape of bad behaviour 
    - want mean around 0 and variance around 1 for the activations to be training properly
    - To be clear, the activations here are the output of `layer(X)` for each layer. For each
          forward pass we can append the value of `layer(X)`for each batch call and take the mean/stf
  		  and append to a list. So each layer has its own list of means/stds.
- All about looking inside the models to debug them. 
- In the first example he used a Sequential Model and hardcoded in the collection of stats manually but we dont have to do things manually. We can use pytorch **hooks**
- forward hooks and backward hooks. Can add them to models / layers.
	- a forward hook calls a function during the forward pass etc.
	- `m.register_forward_hook`
	- do they have hooks in TF?
- hooks and callbacks are the same thing but pytorch calls them hooks. Particular kind of callback.
- __del__ and self.remove() to delete hook after done to free up memory
- these callbacks and hooks are really cool but need to practice 
- context manager hooks class
	- review those context managers, __enter__, __exit__, etc. `with`
- histograms with the single columns of pixels and log values
- 

## TODO
- go over the 09 lesson notebook
  - do lots of it from scratch
	  - update: only have the time to do a lot of copy/paste and running code right now.
		  - There is lots of nice ideas to come back to here.
- 
- can we get the warmup conv classifier I was doing last lesson to work?
  - Can we get the auto encoder to work that I never started

# 17
- some changes to learner, callbacks, and hooks
	- go over those notebooks again

## 11_initialization notebook
- fashion mnist with simple conv
- the activation stats is showing those spike and things are not going well during training
- clean ipython hist utility function
	- also a utility function about cleaning tracebacks
	- these are all about clearing out cuda memory etc when training in notebooks
- why do we need 0 mean and 1 standard deviation on those activation stats?
- have to scale the weight matrices just right
- [paper about this](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf), Xavier Glorot, Yoshua Bengio
	- because of this work we now have a way to initialize nn weights 
- variance is sensitive to outliers because of the square term
	- going over basic mean and std
- covariance - how much 2 things vary .Maybe go over that.
- pearson correlation coeff
- Xavier weight initialization 
- but doesnt work wirth relu activation
	- matirx mult and relu means variance and mean go down
- Kaiming came up with a modified approach, [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852)
	- 	- `init.kaiming_normal_(m.weight)`
- its quite nice, now the lr finder started working 
- but still not training the greatest. Still not working. We forgot something critical
	- the weight matrices are correctly normalized now with the Kaiming method 
	- but not the input!. So need to modify the input so the inputs have mean 0 and variance 1. Can do with a callback that works on each batch actually.
	- and now its training even better with this change
	- stats color dim now looking more rectangular 
	- pretty cool!
- despite normalizing the weights and the inputs, we still not have a mean of 0 and a var of 1. The problem was we are putting the data through a Relu. Relu removes all neg so its impossible for the output of Relu to have a mean of 0. Jeremy think's its incompatible . Came up with idea of taking result of Relu and subtracting something from it. Pull the whole thing down so there are some negatives. And also, while we there use a Leaky Relu.
- General Relu
	- need to make an adjustment when using kaiming_normal with Leak Relu. `a` argument
	- and training even better!
- Now a days, much more complicated activations. Not just relu and leaky relu etc.
	- Need to initialize weights correctly to keep the mean 0 and var 1. Jeremy says many people dont do this part correctly.
	- [paper: all you need is a good init](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06422)
		- general way of initializing neural network weights that works for any activation
			- LSUV - layer-wise Sequential Unit Variance (LSUV)
			- iterative approach. batches, for each layer, bias-mean and weight/std. See notebook/paper for details
		- used a hook. Did not do any weight initialization. Just used LSUV.
- Batch Normalization
	-  very similar in idea to LSUV
	- [2015 paper super famous](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167)
	- we are normalizing the layers weights distributions  but the layers inputs **change** during training. Can fix this issue by normalizing inputs during training
	- [layer normalization paper came out year later](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) and is actually a bit simpler. Start with that.
		- start with this b/c its a simpler technique
		- see simple LayerNorm class in the notebook
		- OH interesting, `x*self.mult + self.add` where `self.mult` and `self.add` start off as 1 and 0 but they are parameters! They are learned during training! Very cool idea.
		- See the forward pass for the details.
		- added layer normalization to each layer except the first one
		- but these layer normalizations can cause some challenges.
			- first batch norm created complexities
			- trend in recent years to not rely so heavily on normalization layers
			- not a silver bullet
	- Now lets look at Batch Norm
		- got the mult and add like before. But now not just one. There is now one for every channel. more learnable params. 
		- but also another difference. See the update_stats method.
			- get the mean per filter and then use lerp. exponentially weighted moving average
			- only updated during training
			- during inference BN layers are frozen
		- remember that BN makes things tricker when doing transfer learning
	- See the nice image diagram from the [group norm paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08494.pdf) which shows the batch norm, later norm, instance norm, group norm
- towards 90%
	- lower batch size to see more samples. Ha very subtle. lower batch size take longer but sees more of the data
	- Momentum learner, fine tune with a smaller lr for final epochs
- and that is the end of initialization, an incredibly important topic

## 12_accel_sgd
- weight decay
- l2 regularization
- momentum
- RMSprop
- Adam (RMSprop + Momentum)



## TODO
- go over those learner callbacks hooks notebooks more carefully and understand it all. I fell behind on those.
- covariance , pearson correlation coeff
	- go over in code and math, 


# 18 
## 12_accel_sgd
- learning rate scheduler
- 1 cycle training
	- [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820)
	- See the plot of learning rate and momentum over time
- Fixup initialization 
	- [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09321)
- T-Fixup
	- [link](https://paperswithcode.com/method/t-fixup)
- Basically there all all these tricks for initializing models

- Back after the break
	- Notice the difference with the `learn` being passed to the callback
	- Oh cool Github Trick, put `/compare` at the end of the PR view URL. So replace `/pulls` with `/compare` to quickly see changes.
	- `@fc.patch` to add a new method to a class. For example `lr_find`

## 13_resnet
- in general, more depth and more layers gives the network more ability to learn
	- in our example made it deeper/wider and got better accuracy
- But there comes a point/time where adding more layers becomes a problem
	- See this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
	- Even became worse on the training. The 56 layer was worse than the 20 layer. This team came up with a really important insight. 
	- They added something called shortcut connections 
	- Instead of being `out=conv2(conv1(in))` lets do `out=conv2(conv1(in)) + in`
		- This is the idea of the skip connection
	- A network that is deep but at the beginning of training it behaves like a shallower network. The `residual` is `out-in` so it's called as **ResnetBlock**
	- Only works if you can add those things `conv2(conv1(in))` and `in` together.
		- The answer is to add a `conv` on `in` and to make it as simple as possible. The simplest most possible conv is a 1by1 kernal size.
	- See code (`_conv_block`) function.
	- I think all these details are explained really well in FranÃ§ois Chollet 
- So now stacking the resnet blocks together
	- notice the new utility functions for printing model shape and summary
	- from 91.7 to 92.2 acc
	- Simplest possible Resnet block
- Also tried the `timm` library (not much better results)
	- goes to show that thoughtful design and architecture goes a long way
	- All about using common sense. Encouraging.

## 14_augment
- data augmentation
- But before we discuss data augmentation
	- some improvements to the model
	- Made it a bit wider
	- change the kernel window size 
	- replace the awkward flatten with the more usable global average pooling
	- Improve the model summary mflops - basic idea counting number of multiplications
	- played around with some different architectures 
	- lowered the total number of params and flops and kept the same accuracy. A good take away is to always look to make the models smaller and faster (less compute).
	- train for 20 epochs and its basically starting to memorize the training data
	- Need more regularization
- With batchnorm, weight decay does not really regularize. Lets Look at Data Augmentation.
- data aug not typically done on eval set 
- batch transform call back
- random crop with padding
- Data aug happening on the GPU.
- Got to 93.8%
	- emphasize: using all the standard tricks 
- Test Time Augmentation (TTA)
- Random Erase
	- delete a little bit of each pic and replace with some noise
	- but replace with noise that has the same stats (mean and std of the image). Because we don't want to change the stats of the image.
	- then does a way (clamp) as not to change the range of the pixel values
- Random Copy
	- same idea. random copy part of image to another.
- Keep seeing the idea of testing line by line in the repl and then after making a function. I feel like I already do this a lot in ipython shell.
- ensemble - trained 2 models and took the average
- HW - try doing your own scheduler, try and beat on MNIST Fashion 5, 10, 20 epochs. Ideally with MiniAI.

# 19
- todo lesson 19 notes
- Introduced DDPM paper and code

# 20
- Jeremy starting with how to do mixed precision
- talking about [Hugging Face Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index)
- Then onto 6A_StyleTransfer By [Jono](https://twitter.com/johnowhitaker)

## 6A_StyleTransfer
- starting with example of random noisy image and training a simple model with MSE loss
with the target being the image of the lady with the sunglasses. And we can train the
model to take the noisy image and output the lady with the sunglasses model. This is more like
a unit test example.
- Now at the 35 minute mark or so and talking about VGG feature extractor
  - reminder of [feature visualization](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/)
- cool idea here
  - take a noisy random image and a target image.
  - extract some features by feeding both noisy input and target image through feature extractor.
  You choose here which layers to use. The layers you pick has an effect on the final outcome.
  - Train the model with MSE loss and use the features extracted in the loss. So you are training
  the input image to have extracted features similar to those of the target. The idea is that
  you will not get an exact replica of the target image in the end like we did with the unit
  test example.
- Now notice that it is still using spatial features. Meaning the thing we get after training
is very spatially similar to the target image. But when we say we want a "style" we don't really
want to copy the exact spatial layout of the target image. We just want the "style"
- This is where the **Style Loss with Gram Matrix* comes into play
  - 55 min mark

## TODO
- try the hooks feature extractor i.e. Homework: Can you do this using hooks
